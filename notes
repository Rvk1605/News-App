Component Life Cycyle :- It is a series of events that happen from the mounting of a react component to its Unmounting.

Mounting :Birth of a Component
Update :Growth of a Component 
Unmount :Death of a component

Methods in React Component LifeCycle:-

render() method - It is used to render HTML of the component in react.It is required for a class based component to render the DOM.It runs during the mounting and Updating of the component.It should be Pure i.e we cannot modify state inside it.

componentDidmount() = it runs  after the component output  has been rendered to the DOM.

componentDidupdate() = it is invoked as soon as the updating happens. it update the DOM in response to prop or state change.

componentWillUnmount() = it is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed .Performs Cleanup

React Hooks :-

->Features of Class based Components in function based Components.
->It allows you to use state and other React Features without writing a class
->Hooks are the Functions which hook into React State and LifeCycle Features from function components.

Commonly USed React hooks:-

=>useState
=>useEffect - Alternate for Component did Mount.
=>useContext - used for using context api (decrease the drilling of props , make any state /function global for any component to use it).
=>useRef - useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.
            A common use case is to access a child imperatively


Note:- 

In Function Componet Prop Types are written below functional Component.
